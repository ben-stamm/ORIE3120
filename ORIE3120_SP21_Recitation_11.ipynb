    "In this recitation we will learn how to employ the newsvendor problem to solve a scheduling problem. More specifically, we want to find the optimal number of nurses to be scheduled to work on the quarantine & isolation team at Cornell Health to handle positive COVID tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a student tests positive, this team of nurses calls that student to check on their symptoms and to move them to a room at a hotel. The nursing team also calls students identified as close contacts of the positive student, and who may have already been infected, to move them into quarantine at a hotel. This is done to protect against the possibility that others would be infected by coming into contact with someone who is infectious. In many cases this is straightforward but it sometimes requires a substantial amount of work: the person being contacted might have a medical situation that requires extra attention (either from COVID or another condition); might not answer their phone (requiring repeated calls); might be belligerent or misrepresent the truth (requiring a longer conversation and sometimes the use of additional resources); or might simply have a great number of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a newsvendor problem because demand is stochastic and there is a cost both for scheduling too few nurses, and for scheduling too many.  If we schedule too many nurses, we create a burden for them and risk burning out the nursing team. If we schedule too few, we can ask unscheduled nurses to come on and work at the last minute, but this forces them to drop their personal life and start working (creating a burden and risknig burnout). Also, scheduling too few nurses creates a risk that we might not be able to contact and move to quarantine / isolation all of the students who are potentially infectious, risking the creation of new COVID cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the arrival period for the Spring 2021 semester. During this period, students arriving from elsewhere were testing positive due to infections acquired at home. The rapid increase in arriving students and the changing nature of nationwide and international prevalence relative to the Fall 2020 semester made it difficult to plan based on past experience. This made mathematical modeling extremely useful. Indeed, code close to this recitation was actually used to make staffing decisions at Cornell Health over this period."

    "We can do this here by solving the optimization problem for many different values of alpha, calculating the underage and overage for each one, and then plotting underage vs. overage.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our current model only simulates a single day. However, we would like to have an optimal schedule for the number of nurses to employ for an entire period, say 3 weeks. We could do this by making 21 plots using the code above, one for each day, using the number of students scheduled to arrive for that day. We could then show each of those 21 plots to management and have them pick out a point on each plot. This would be a pain, however. It is better to show them a single plot for the entire 3-week period and have them select a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we would like to introduce the possibility that a student does not test positive immediately upon arriving and thus contacts multiple students during the time he/she goes undetected. For simplicity, we do not assume the contacted students spread the virus to other contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a student arriving on day 0 may not test positive until day 4, and he/she may contact 6 students. We will implement this improved model below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do so, note that our objective is essentially still the same as above: for a particular $\\alpha$ optimally choose the number of nurses to schedule to minimize the expected total cost. However, our choice of nurses to schedule is no longer a scalar, since we are considering *many* days as opposed to a single day. Rather, it is a vector (say, $\\vec{N}$) whose length is the number of days in the period we are considering, and whose $j$th entry is our choice of the number of nurses to employ on day $j$.  "
